This is an open source Ruby project. Review CONTRIBUTING.md for information on working in this codebase.

Be sure all Ruby code matches the standardrb linting rules. Use `bundle exec rake standardrb --fix` on the file if needed.

Prefer functional programming patterns where applicable. Avoid monkey patching. Avoid removing the trailing newline at the end of source code files.

When writing scripts, prefer writing them in Ruby. Alternately, they can be written in bash if the the script is primarily interacting with the file system and running shell commands.

When iterating on Ruby code changes, use `bundle exec rspec path/to/file` to run a focused subset of tests related to your changes. Then, before committing, run `script/quick_build` to confirm the entire build passes.

Our CI build enforces 100% test coverage, so when writing tests, be sure that the tests cover all lines and branches of implementation code. `# :nocov:` can be used to mark code as uncovered in rare situations if needed.

When iterating on website changes, use `bundle exec rake site:build`, and look at the resulting output in `config/site/_site`.
