# ElasticGraph Project Memory Bank

This document serves as the primary, single source of truth for understanding the ElasticGraph project.

## Product Context

-   **Why this project exists**: ElasticGraph is a general purpose, near real-time data query and search platform.
-   **Problems it solves**: It addresses the need for a scalable and performant platform for rich interactive queries and simplified creation of complex reports.
-   **How it should work**: It combines the indexing and search power of Elasticsearch/OpenSearch with the query flexibility of GraphQL. It is optimized for AWS cloud.
-   **User experience goals**:
    -   Minimize network trips for data retrieval.
    -   Get exactly the needed data in a single query (no over- or under-serving).
    -   Push filtering and complex calculations to the backend.

## System Patterns

ElasticGraph is designed to be modular with a small core and many built-in extensions. The codebase is a monorepo containing multiple Ruby gems.

Key architectural characteristics:
-   **Modular Design**: Composed of several categories of gems:
    -   Core Libraries
    -   AWS Lambda Integration Libraries
    -   Extensions
    -   Datastore Adapters (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch)
    -   Local Development Libraries
-   **GraphQL API**: Central to its query capabilities.
-   **Search Backend**: Leverages Elasticsearch or OpenSearch.
-   **AWS Optimized**: With specific libraries for AWS Lambda deployment.

(Dependency diagrams and more detailed architecture will be added as more components are analyzed).

```
**Description of Interaction Flow:**
1.  **Developer Tools & Local Dev Libs**: Developers use these (e.g., `elasticgraph` CLI, `elasticgraph-local` Rake tasks) to bootstrap projects and interact with the Schema Definition DSL.
2.  **Schema Definition DSL**: The `elasticgraph-schema_definition` gem provides the Ruby DSL used to define the entire data and GraphQL schema.
3.  **Generated Schema Artifacts**: The Schema Definition process outputs various artifact files (SDL, YAML metadata, JSON schemas, datastore configs). These are consumed by the `elasticgraph-schema_artifacts` gem.
4.  **Core Runtime Libraries**: These gems (e.g., `elasticgraph-graphql`, `elasticgraph-indexer`, `elasticgraph-datastore_core`) form the heart of the application. They use the loaded Schema Artifacts to understand the data model and interact with the datastore.
5.  **Datastore Adapters**: These gems (`elasticgraph-elasticsearch`, `elasticgraph-opensearch`) provide the specific clients and communication logic for Core Libraries to talk to the chosen datastore.
6.  **Physical Datastore**: The actual Elasticsearch or OpenSearch instance.
7.  **AWS Lambda Integration Libs**: These gems wrap Core Libraries to deploy them as serverless functions, using Datastore Adapters for connectivity.
8.  **Deployed Lambda Functions**: The runtime serverless components.
9.  **Extension Gems**: These gems plug into and extend the functionality of the Core Runtime Libraries (e.g., adding Apollo Federation support, health checks, query registry).

## Other Key Information

This section highlights other important aspects of the ElasticGraph project:

-   **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**:
    -   The project emphasizes robust testing, with each gem typically containing unit, integration, and sometimes acceptance tests using RSpec.
    -   A shared `spec_support/` directory likely provides common testing utilities across the monorepo.
    -   VCR is used for caching datastore requests/responses during local test runs to speed up development, but it's disabled in CI to ensure tests run against live dependencies.
    -   Flatware is utilized for parallel RSpec execution, further optimizing test suite run times.

-   **Datastore Scripting with Painless**:
    -   ElasticGraph leverages Painless scripts for advanced datastore operations within Elasticsearch/OpenSearch.
    -   These scripts are defined and managed by the `elasticgraph-schema_definition` gem (see `lib/elastic_graph/schema_definition/scripting/` and artifacts in `config/schema/artifacts/datastore_config.yaml`).
    -   They are used for tasks such as custom field logic, data updates (especially for derived fields and ensuring idempotency), and complex filtering operations directly at the datastore level.

-   **Monorepo Management and Tooling**:
    -   The project employs several custom scripts in the `script/` directory to automate monorepo maintenance tasks.
    -   `script/update_dependency_diagrams`: Dynamically generates the `CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md` file by inspecting gem metadata and dependencies. This is crucial for keeping the high-level project documentation accurate.
    -   `script/update_ci_yaml`: Manages the GitHub Actions CI workflow configuration (specifically `ci.yaml`), synchronizing it with tested datastore versions defined in `config/tested_datastore_versions.yaml`.
    -   Other scripts handle tasks like license updates, type checking, and running various test suites.

-   **AI Tools Integration (Experimental/Future)**:
    -   The presence of an `ai_tools/` directory containing `elasticgraph-mcp-server` (a Python-based tool) suggests potential or planned integration with AI/ML model control planes or related functionalities. The exact nature and usage are not fully detailed within the current primary codebase documentation.

-   **Ruby and Datastore Versioning**:
    -   The project specifies Ruby `~> 3.4` as its required version.
    -   It actively tests against a defined set of Elasticsearch and OpenSearch versions, managed in `config/tested_datastore_versions.yaml` and enforced in the CI pipeline.

### Configuration Management and Schema

ElasticGraph configuration is primarily managed through:
1.  **YAML files**: Located in `config/settings/` (e.g., `development.yaml`, `test.yaml.template`). These files define environment-specific settings such as datastore connection details, client configurations, index settings (shards, replicas), and paths to schema artifacts.
2.  **Ruby DSL for Schema Definition**: The core schema is defined programmatically using a Ruby DSL provided by the `elasticgraph-schema_definition` gem. The main entry point is `config/schema.rb`, which typically loads other `.rb` files from `config/schema/` (e.g., `teams.rb`, `widgets.rb`) that contain the detailed type, field, and relationship definitions.

**Schema Artifacts** are generated from the Ruby DSL definitions via Rake tasks (e.g., `rake schema_artifacts:dump`). These artifacts are stored in `config/schema/artifacts/` (and `config/schema/artifacts_with_apollo/` if Apollo Federation is used) and include:
-   `schema.graphql`: The GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) representation of the schema.
-   `runtime_metadata.yaml`: A detailed YAML representation of the schema, including type information, field resolvers, index definitions, and update targets. This is used by `elasticgraph-schema_artifacts` to provide an in-memory object model of the schema at runtime.
-   `json_schemas.yaml`: Public JSON Schema definitions for data types, intended for data publishers to validate events. Includes an `ElasticGraphEventEnvelope` definition.
-   `json_schemas_by_version/v1.yaml`: An internal version of the JSON schemas, potentially with additional ElasticGraph-specific metadata.
-   `datastore_config.yaml`: Defines Elasticsearch/OpenSearch index templates (including mappings and settings for fields like `keyword`, `date`, `nested`, `geo_point`) and Painless scripts for custom datastore operations.

This separation allows for a developer-friendly Ruby DSL for defining the schema while providing static, machine-readable artifacts for runtime use and for external consumers (like data publishers). The Apollo-specific artifacts demonstrate how extensions can augment the schema and its generated representations.

## Development Scripts (`script/`)

The `script/` directory contains various scripts for development, maintenance, and CI tasks:

-   `update_gem_constraints`: Manages gem version constraints, likely within `.gemspec` files or the main `Gemfile`.
-   `update_dependency_diagrams`: Dynamically generates the `CODEBASE_OVERVIEW.md` file by inspecting gem metadata and dependencies. This is crucial for keeping the high-level project documentation accurate.
-   `update_licenses`: Scans and updates license information for project dependencies.
-   `quick_build`: Provides a potentially faster, possibly less comprehensive, build option for local development.
-   `spellcheck`: Runs spell-checking across the codebase.
-   `run_gem_specs`: A utility to execute RSpec tests for individual gems or all gems within the monorepo.
-   `flatware_rspec`: Likely executes RSpec tests in parallel using the Flatware tool.
-   `update_ci_yaml`: Automates updates to the GitHub Actions CI workflow configuration (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`), especially for the matrix of datastore versions being tested. It reads version information from `config/tested_datastore_versions.yaml`.
-   `run_specs`: A general script to run various test suites.
-   `type_check`: Executes Steep for static type checking using RBS files.
-   `list_eg_gems.rb`: A Ruby script that lists all ElasticGraph-specific gems within the repository.
-   `enable_custom_gemfile`: Manages the use of a custom Gemfile for development, potentially by symlinking or copying `Gemfile-custom.example`.
-   `ci_parts/`: This subdirectory (seen in the initial file listing) likely contains helper scripts that are executed as part of the CI pipeline.
