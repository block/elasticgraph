The most commonly used predicate supports equality filtering:

{% include filtering_predicate_definitions/equality.md %}

Here's a basic example:

{% include copyable_code_snippet.html language="graphql" data="music_queries.filtering.FindU2OrRadiohead" %}

Unlike the SQL `IN` operator, you can find records with `null` values if you put `null` in the list:

{% include copyable_code_snippet.html language="graphql" data="music_queries.filtering.FindUnnamedVenues" %}
