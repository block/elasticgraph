# ElasticGraph::Apollo

Implements the [Apollo Federation Subgraph Spec](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/),
allowing an ElasticGraph application to be plugged into an Apollo-powered GraphQL server as a subgraph.

Note: this library only supports the v2 Federation specification.

## Usage

First, add `elasticgraph-apollo` to your `Gemfile`, alongside the other ElasticGraph gems:

```diff
diff --git a/Gemfile b/Gemfile
index 4a5ef1e..5c16c2b 100644
--- a/Gemfile
+++ b/Gemfile
@@ -8,6 +8,7 @@ gem "elasticgraph-query_registry", *elasticgraph_details

 gem "elasticgraph-opensearch", *elasticgraph_details
+gem "elasticgraph-apollo", *elasticgraph_details

 gem "httpx", "~> 1.3"

```

Finally, update `Rakefile` so that `ElasticGraph::GraphQL::Apollo::SchemaDefinition::APIExtension` is
used as one of the `extension_modules`:

```diff
diff --git a/Rakefile b/Rakefile

That's it!

## Federation Version Support

This library supports multiple versions of Apollo federation. As of Jan. 2024, it supports:

* v2.0
* v2.3
* v2.5
* v2.6

By default, the newest version is targeted. If you need an older version (e.g. because your organization is running
an older Apollo version), you can configure it in your schema definition with `schema.target_apollo_federation_version`:

```diff
diff --git a/config/schema.rb b/config/schema.rb
index 015c5fa..362cdcb 100644
