module ElasticGraph
  # ElasticGraph extension library that implements the [Apollo subgraph federation
  # spec](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/), turning
  # any ElasticGraph instance into an Apollo subgraph.
  #
  # `ElasticGraph::Apollo` has two parts:
  #
  # * {Apollo::SchemaDefinition} is an extension used while defining an ElasticGraph schema. It includes all schema elements that are part
  #   of the Apollo spec, including `_Entity` and the various directives.
  # * {Apollo::GraphQL} is an extension used by `elasticgraph-graphql` to support queries against Apollo's subgraph schema additions (e.g.
  #   `_service` and `_entities`). It includes [reference resolvers](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/entities/#2-define-a-reference-resolver)
  #   for all indexed types in your schema.
  #
  # To use `elasticgraph-apollo`, simply use {Apollo::SchemaDefinition::APIExtension} as a schema definition extension module. The GraphQL
  # extension module will get used by `elasticgraph-graphql` automatically.
  #
  # @example Use elasticgraph-apollo in a project
  #   require "elastic_graph/apollo/schema_definition/api_extension"
  #
  #   ElasticGraph::Local::RakeTasks.new(
  #     local_config_yaml: "config/settings/local.yaml",
  #     path_to_schema: "config/schema.rb"
  #   ) do |tasks|
  #     tasks.schema_definition_extension_modules = [ElasticGraph::Apollo::SchemaDefinition::APIExtension]
  #   end
  module Apollo
    # Namespace for all Apollo schema definition support.
    #
    # {SchemaDefinition::APIExtension} is the primary entry point and should be used as a schema definition extension module.
    module SchemaDefinition
      # Module designed to be extended onto an {ElasticGraph::SchemaDefinition::API} instance
      # to customize the schema artifacts based on the [Apollo Federation subgraph
      # spec](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/).
      #
      # To use this module, pass it in `schema_definition_extension_modules` when defining your {ElasticGraph::Local::RakeTasks}.
      #
      # @example Define local rake tasks with this extension module
      #   require "elastic_graph/apollo/schema_definition/api_extension"

                    * Add it to the `apollo_key`
