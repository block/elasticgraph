          # Building an `DatastoreQuery` is not cheap; we do a lot of work to:
          #
          # 1) Convert the `args` to their schema form.
          # 2) Reduce over our different query builders into a final `Query` object
          # 3) ...and those individual query builders often do a lot of work (traversing lookaheads, etc).
          #
          # So it is beneficial to avoid re-creating the exact same `DatastoreQuery` object when
          # we are resolving the same field in the context of a different object. For example,
          # consider a query like:
          #
          # query {
          #   widgets {
          #     components {
          #       id
          #       parts {
          #         id
          #       }
          #     }
          #   }
          # }
          #
          # Here `components` and `parts` are nested relation fields. If we load 50 of each collection,
          # this `build_query_from` method will be called 50 times for the `Widget.components` field,
          # and 2500 times (50 * 50) for the `Component.parts` field...but for a given field, the
          # built `DatastoreQuery` will be exactly the same.
          #
          # Therefore, it is beneficial to memoize the `DatastoreQuery` to avoid re-doing the same work
          # over and over again, provided we can do so safely.
          #
          # `context` is a hash-like `GraphQL::Query::Context` object. Each executed query gets its own
          # instance, so we can safely cache things in it and trust that it will not "leak" to another
          # query execution. We carefully build a cache key below to ensure that we only ever reuse
          # the same `DatastoreQuery` in a situation that would produce the exact same `DatastoreQuery`.
