    # For example, we initially implemented aggregation `size` support in a way that
    # triggered a `null_pointer_exception` in one shard, which caused the datastore to
    # return a partial response that our router handled by logging a warning. The
    # `:capture_logs` here caused the tests to fail until we fixed that issue.
