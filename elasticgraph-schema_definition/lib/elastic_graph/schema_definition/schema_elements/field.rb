              `#{parent_type.name}.#{name}` is a list-of-objects field, but the mapping type has not been explicitly specified. Elasticsearch and OpenSearch
              offer two ways to index list-of-objects fields. It cannot be changed on an existing field without dropping the index and recreating it (losing
              any existing indexed data!), and there are nuanced tradeoffs involved here, so ElasticGraph provides no default mapping in this situation.

              If you're currently prototyping and don't want to spend time weighing this tradeoff, we recommend you do this:

              ```
              t.field "#{name}", "#{type.name}" do |f|
                # Here we are opting for flexibility (nested) over pure performance (object).
                # TODO: evaluate if we want to stick with `nested` before going to production.
                f.mapping type: "nested"
              end
              ```

              Read on for details of the tradeoff involved here.

              -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

              Here are the options:

              1) `f.mapping type: "object"` will cause each field path to be indexed as a separate "flattened" list.

              For example, given a `Film` document like this:

              ```
              {
                "name": "The Empire Strikes Back",
                "characters": [
                  {"first": "Luke", "last": "Skywalker"},
                  {"first": "Han", "last": "Solo"}
                ]
              }
              ```

              ...the data will look like this in the inverted Lucene index:

              ```
              {
                "name": "The Empire Strikes Back",
                "characters.first": ["Luke", "Han"],
                "characters.last": ["Skywalker", "Solo"]
              }
              ```

              This is highly efficient, but there is no way to search on multiple fields of a character and be sure that the matching values came from the same character.
              ElasticGraph models this in the filtering API it offers for this case:

              ```
              query {
                films(filter: {
                  characters: {
                    first: {#{schema_def_state.schema_elements.any_satisfy}: {#{schema_def_state.schema_elements.equal_to_any_of}: ["Luke"]}}
                    last: {#{schema_def_state.schema_elements.any_satisfy}: {#{schema_def_state.schema_elements.equal_to_any_of}: ["Skywalker"]}}
                  }
                }) {
                  # ...
                }
              }
              ```

              As suggested by this filtering API, this will match any film that has a character with a first name of "Luke" and a character
              with the last name of "Skywalker", but this could be satisfied by two separate characters.

              2) `f.mapping type: "nested"` will cause each _object_ in the list to be indexed as a separate hidden document, preserving the independence of each.

              Given a `Film` document like "The Empire Strikes Back" from above, the `nested` type will index separate hidden documents for each character. This
              allows ElasticGraph to offer this filtering API instead:

              ```
              query {
                films(filter: {
                  characters: {#{schema_def_state.schema_elements.any_satisfy}: {
                    first: {#{schema_def_state.schema_elements.equal_to_any_of}: ["Luke"]}
                    last: {#{schema_def_state.schema_elements.equal_to_any_of}: ["Skywalker"]}
                  }}
                }) {
                  # ...
                }
              }
              ```

              As suggested by this filtering API, this will only match films that have a character named "Luke Skywalker". However, the Elasticsearch docs[^1][^2] warn
              that the `nested` mapping type can lead to performance problems, and index sorting cannot be configured[^3] when the `nested` type is used.
