# Limit the number of workers to 8. On some really beefy CI worker hosts, we've seen
# flatware default to 96 workers (due to the host having 96 vCPUs!), but that's overkill,
# and using too many workers can perform worse.
#
# In addition, using too many parallel processes can overwhelm the locally booted datastore,
# because we have to create a separate set of indices for each process. The datastore tends
# to run into limits when we use 16 processes. 8 processes seems to work better
#
# Note: `Etc.nprocessors` is what flatware uses internally for the default number of workers.
