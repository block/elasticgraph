# This script identifies all of the local ElasticGraph gems in this repo.
# It is designed to be usable from Ruby without shelling out (just require
# it and call `ElasticGraphGems.list`) but also callable from a shell script
# (just run this script).
#
# Note that it does assume that all gems are in a direct subdirectory of the
# the repository root. Our glob only looks one level deep to avoid pulling in
# gems that could be installed in `bundle` (e.g. if `bundle --standalone` is
# being used).
