# This script is meant to run a "quick" build. A "full" build performed on CI
# isn't terribly suitable for engineers running locally: it assumes everything
# has to be setup from scratch, and opts for completeness/strictness over build
# speed to an extreme level that is great for CI but not for local builds.
# For example, it opts in to some extra GraphQL schema validation and runs the
# test suite without VCR, which verifies the test suite passes without VCR
# recordings, but makes the test suite take much longer (e.g. 2.5-3 minutes
# instead 30-45 seconds). Similarly, the full CI build runs the specs "file by file"
# to ensure every spec file passes when run on its own. This fails *very* rarely but
# is quite slow so we do not want to include it here.

# Abort script at first error, when a command exits with non-zero status.
# Verbose form of `set -e`.
set -o errexit

# Attempt to use undefined variable outputs error message, and forces an exit
# Verbose form of `set -u`.
set -o nounset

# If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost)
# command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the
# pipeline exit successfully.
set -o pipefail

# Print a trace of simple commands.
# Verbose form of `set -x`.
