require "date"
require "elastic_graph/spec_support/factories/shared"

# Note: it is *essential* that all factories defined here generate records
# deterministically, in order for the request bodies to (and responses from)
# the datastore to not change between VCR cassettes being recorded and replayed.

# Note: in our JSON Schema, `__typename` is defined for ALL object types but is only _required_ on abstract object types
# (e.g. for type unions or interfaces). However, clients that publish using egpublisher always include it on every object
# type (because of how the code gen works).
#
# In addition, in the factories here we require it on all indexed types (the ones with `parent: :graph_base`) because
# `Indexer::TestSupport::Converters.upsert_event_for` relies on it in order to build the event envelope. That process strips the
# `__typename` from the `record`.
#
# We intentionally include `__typename` in many non-indexed object types here in order to simulate it being set on them
# (since that's what our publishers do) in order to exercise edge cases related to `__typename`. However, we haven't
# included it in all object types since some publishers could omit it.

# A fixed date we can use instead of `Date.today` in our factories.
# As mentioned above, our factories are intended to be deterministic, and we need to avoid using `Date.today` (or `Time.now`) to
# ensure determinism.
